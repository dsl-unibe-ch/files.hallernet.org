# files.hallernet.org

Legacy file server of the hallerNet platform.

This server was in use in the early phase of hallernet.org as a read-only file server hosting

* IIIF images
* legacy websites (static php)
* event materials
* presentation materials
* misc materials

Technically, it was set up as a Docker container running on a NAS and offering an Nginx directory listing, prettified with h5ai.

In order to keep shared links alive the service is reinstated in a simplified way as a Github page (sans IIIF images).
