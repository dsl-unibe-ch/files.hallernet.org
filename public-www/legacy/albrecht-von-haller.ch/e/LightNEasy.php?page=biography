    <h2>Youth, studies</h2>
<p>Haller was the fifth and youngest child of Niklaus Emanuel  Haller, a jurist, and Anna Maria Engel. He studied medicine in T&uuml;bingen  and especially in Leiden with Herman Boerhaave, the leading medical  authority of his time. After graduation in 1727, he visited England  briefly and completed his anatomical and surgical studies in Paris and  learnt the foundations of higher mathematics from Johannes Bernoulli in  Basel. From 1729 to 1736 he worked as a physician in Bern and published  some first minor works in anatomy and botany. He achieved his first  fame, however, with his Essay of Swiss Poems (Versuch Schweizerischer Gedichte,  1732), which served as the model for descriptive and philosophical  poetry for the next generation and made Haller the most highly esteemed  German poet of the 1730s and 1740s.</p>
<h2>Professor in G&ouml;ttingen</h2>
<p>In 1736, Haller was called as professor of anatomy, botany and  surgery to the newly established University of G&ouml;ttingen, where he  stayed until 1753. In this period of intense scientific activity, he  developed his main areas of research and laid the foundations of later  works. In 1742, he published a massive flora of Switzerland and was soon  acknowledged as one of the leading botanists and as the most important  opponent of Linnean nomenclature. As an anatomist, he focused on the  vascular system and set the new standard in this particular branch with  his Icones anatomicae (8 parts, 1743&ndash;56).</p>
<p>Haller&rsquo;s main interest, however, was physiology, the study of  the functions of the living body. Convinced that fundamental insights  into the function of the living body can only be gained by the  examination of the living body itself, Haller started in the late 1740s  with various series of animal experiments. He was the first to perform  animal experiments on a large scale, guided by a well defined set of  questions and carried out in a systematic manner. His results created a  revolution in medical theory. They showed that the body was not &ndash; as  hithertho thought &ndash; a passive machine guided by the soul but an active  organism reacting to stimulations. This insight changed not only the  conception of life in general but also of health and sickness. Whereas  the physicians before 1750 attributed sickness mainly to a disturbance  in the motion of fluids and fibers they now increasingly considered  alterations of irritability and sensibility as the source of all  diseases.</p>
<p>In recognition of his scientific contributions, Haller was  ennobled by the emperor in 1749. More importantly, his standing was  confirmed by membership of the main European academies, ie. those of  Uppsala (1733), London (1739), Stockholm (1747), Berlin (1749), Bologna  (1751) and Paris (1754). In 1751, he was elected perpetual president of  the newly founded Royal Academy of Sciences of G&ouml;ttingen (G&ouml;ttingen was  part of the Hanoverian empire). Besides his various scientific and  literary activities, Haller was also busy as chief editor (1747&ndash;53) of  the G&ouml;ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, the leading German review journal, for which he penned some 9,000 reviews in the years 1747&ndash;77.</p>
<h2>Civil servant in Bern</h2>
<p>Despite his international fame as a scientist Haller was never  really happy in G&ouml;ttingen. The loss of two dearly loved wifes and of  three young children, his quarrels with colleagues from the university  and the separation from his home and his friends in Bern weighted down  on him. Setting his hopes on a political career and aiming to secure the  social and economic position of his family in Bernese patrician  society, Haller returned to his home town in 1753. He had already in  1745 been elected as member of the Great Council (Grosser Rat) and was now appointed as Rathausammann,  a relatively modest charge in itself but a good position to set up a  political career. In 1758 Haller was elected director of the salt mines  in Roche in the French part of the Bernese territories, a well paid and  respected position which he accepted gladly as he could continue to  perform his own research and implement some of the agricultural reforms  he promoted. In 1764, he returned to Bern and continued to work as an  important member of various Bernese municipal bodies such as the  Economic Committee and the Medical Council. Due to his multiple role as  an 'enlightened' civil servant, author of essential treatises (on fodder  plants, cereals and rinderpest) and president of the Economic Society  of Bern (1766, 1768, 1770&ndash;1777) he was one of the central figures of the  economic-patriotic reform movement in Bern.</p>
<h2>Late works</h2>
<p>Haller&rsquo;s return to Switzerland was not a farewell to the  Republic of Letters. He continued to maintain his vast correspondence,  of which 3,700 letters to and 13,300 from 1,200 persons have survived.  And he did not relent in his scientific activity. He proceeded with his  embryological investigations, already started in G&ouml;ttingen, and  published his major works on the development of the chicken embryo in  1758 and 1767. His opus magnum, the Elementa physiologiae, appeared in  eight volumes over a period of ten years (1757&ndash;66). Haller presented his  views on anatomy and physiology to the wider public in the Yverdon and  the supplements to the Paris Encylop&eacute;die (1772&ndash;77), for which he wrote  some 200 articles. A second, considerably revised and enlarged edition  of his Swiss flora, was published in 1768. Remote from major centres of  academia, he continued to build up his large library with more than  23,000 titles, mostly belonging to the medical, botanical and natural  sciences. The last decade of his life Haller devoted to the edition of  critically commented bibliographies of botany, anatomy, physiology,  surgery and the practice of medicine. In 10 volumes, he presented and  discussed some 50,000 works from all branches of medicine. Besides that,  he wrote three novels on the principles of government and religious  works against the French freethinkers, notably Voltaire. Haller obtained  perhaps the greatest satisfaction of his life in July 1777, half a year  before his death, when the emperor Joseph II &ndash; on his &lsquo;incognito&rsquo;  voyage through Europe &ndash; declined to visit the philosophe in Ferney but  called upon our scholar in Bern.</p>
